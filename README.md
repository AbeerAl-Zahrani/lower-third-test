# lower-third-test

Welcome to the Lower Third Test!,

Since its small Project, I chose to not use React Library or Typescript.Only vanilla Javascript and p5.dom library (built into p5.js) for lower third animation 

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (v16.x or higher recommended)
* npm (v8.x or higher recommended)
* A modern browser (for viewing the dashboard and graphic)

Getting Started:

* Clone the repository
* cd NodeCG
* Install dependencies(npm install)
* nodecg start
